TODO List:

High Prio
=========
- Fix footer logos and add in the Google API badge as well

- If geolocation fails, fall back to Untappd user info
  - If user is not logged in, revert to Raleigh

- Query breweries in Google based on location. 
  - Compare these results to what is in Untappd (should only be 3-4 breweries, maybe 2 requests per berwery)

Ideas
=====
- Rearrange layout to 2 horizontal scroll bars for beer/brewery results
